# minimal blazer theme for obsidian

- this theme is a *modified version* of the popular [Obsidian Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) theme
- all credits go to the original authors of the Obsidian Minimal theme, where their license can be found [here](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal#license)

- original blazer colourscheme can be found at [gogh-co.github.io](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/), [and their github here](https://github.com/Gogh-Co/Gogh)

- this is primarily a recolour with the blazer theme, but with some tweaks to the UI here and there.
